My favorite part about what we learned about python in class was regex and it being a simple yet powerful tool. It allows the user to sort out and find things quickly and efficiently. It wasn't until I understood the code below did it start to click with me. That 'aha' moment of understanding felt like magic and I'm glad I took the time to decipher why both bits of code yielded what they did. That opened a great number of doors for me and it was then when I was able to finally appreciate the power of regex. 


import re
string="regex is so fun!"
match=re.match(r"regex.* is",string)
match.group()

# 'regex is'

match=re.match(r"regex.+ is",string)
#match.group() ERROR: NO MATCH
